# DrumKit

This is a simple web application that produces the sound of a drum kit when the user clicks on the drum buttons or presses specific keys on the keyboard.

# Usage
To use the Drum Kit, follow these steps:

+ Open the index.html file in a web browser.

+ Once the page is loaded, you will see a set of drum buttons displayed on the screen.

+ Click on the drum buttons using your mouse, or press the corresponding keys on your keyboard to play the associated drum sound.

+ The drum buttons are mapped to the following keys on the keyboard:
w - Crash
a - Kick
s - Snare
d - Tom 1
j - Tom 2
k - Tom 3
l - Tom 4
+ When a button is clicked or a key is pressed, the corresponding drum sound will be played, and the button will briefly animate to indicate the action.

# Enjoy playing the virtual drum kit!

 + index.html: The HTML file that defines the structure and content of the web page.

 + styles.css: The CSS file that contains the styles for the web page.
